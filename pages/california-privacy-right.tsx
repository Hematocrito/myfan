        consumer request on behalf of your minor child. <br />
        <br /> You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or
        data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer
        request must: <br /> Provide sufficient information that allows us to
        reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal
        information or an authorized representative. <br />

        properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. We cannot respond to
        your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot
        verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the
        personal information relates to you. <br />
        <br />

        also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.
        For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your

        transmit the information from one entity to another entity without
        hindrance. <br />

        consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly
        unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell
        you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate
        before completing your request. <br />

        by the CCPA that can result in different prices, rates, or quality
        levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably
        relate to your personal information’s value and contain written terms
        that describe the program’s material aspects. Participation in a
        financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which
        you may revoke at any time.
